## Overview
This project is to provide an All-in-one tool for all people that are interested in either their own cities or different ones. Through the use of APIs, CEA allows the user to check for things like location, weather, movies and more.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
We are using HTML, CSS and javascript for the front-end. Node.js and horuko for the back-end.

Also there are APIs used for location, weather and trails.
